# Intro-Slider

description--> when an app is launched for the first time, user comes across various slides telling about the uses and benifits of the application.


Intro slider comes in many forms. one can define animations so that when a user swipes one screen, diffrent types of event occurs. these maybe flipping the screen, zoomin/out effect, fading effect etc. these codes are openly available on developer.android.com. 

This is just a small peice of work for introductory sliding tour to the functioning and working of an android application. One can simply use the tutorial file (which soon is going to be put up), make some changes and use this in their applications. 

Happy coding! cheers!
